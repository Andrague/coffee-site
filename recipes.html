        <h2>GENMAICHA LATTE</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed that matcha and hojicha are often featured on this tea blog. I consume those two Japanese green teas the most, but genmaicha is next in line! Genmaicha is a Japanese green tea blend that can actually be combined with matcha or hojicha for a unique flavour. But I like this tea best on its own. Similar to most teas, genmaicha can be enjoyed a few different ways. The savoury flavours make it great to use as a broth for soups. It can be used to make a warm and toasty green tea latte as well. If you want to change up your usual matcha latte or hojicha latte for another Japanese tea, follow this easy genmaicha latte recipe!<span id="dots">...</span><div class="dn"></div><span id="more">
        <p>
        <h4 class="ingredients">-Water</h4>
        The best water temperature to use when steeping genmaicha is 82°C or 180°F. The tea leaves may burn and steep a bitter cup if the water is too hot.

        <h4 class="ingredients"> -Sweetener</h4>
        You can sweeten this latte with any type of sweetener. However, I really enjoy sweetening my genmaicha latte with brown sugar or honey. Alternatively, you can keep this genmaicha latte sugar free and skip this ingredient all together.

        <h4 class="ingredients">-Milk</h4>
        Heat the milk before frothing for best results.
        <h4 class="ingredients">Here is what you will need:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon genmaicha, loose leaf (or 2 tea bags)</li>
        <li>½ cup hot water (82°C or 180°F)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweetener of choice</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        </ul>
       
        Steep genmaicha green tea in a mug with hot water for 3 minutes. The water temperature should be under boiling at about 82°C or 180°F.<br>

                <h4 class="ingredients">Traditional Macchiato Steps</h4>
                We’re dealing with a tiny beverage, and maintaining heat is important. Preheat your machine, and especially your espresso cup.

                Grind out your usual espresso dose (we use 18g in this Breville Barista Pro), level, tamp, and lock the portafilter in the machine.

                Here, decide if you want two singles or one double. We’re brewing a double in this example.

                <h4 class="ingredients">Prepare Milk for Microfoam</h4>
                While your shot is brewing, get your milk ready. We like to go with about 100ml of whole milk, and add about 25ml of half and half (10% cream) milk for an added creamy sweet boost.

                <h4 class="ingredients">Make Low Temp Microfoam</h4>
                Here’s a secret to a fantastic traditional macchiato: you don’t have to steam milk up to the usual 65C (150F); in fact, your microfoam will be better tasting and have a more sweeter impact if you only steam to about 40C (105F). And that’s our target – create paint-like microfoam but don’t go hot
                <img src="./img/Finish_Milk_Stretching.jpg" alt="Finish Milk Stretching">
                <h4 class="ingredients">Finish Milk Stretching</h4>
                Once the steam pitcher is the slightest bit warm to your hand’s touch, it’s time to end the milk stretching and steaming in general. This is a good rule of thumb for maximizing the milk’s sweetness for your drink. Note I have not submerged the wand at this point.
                <img src="./img/Spoon_Out_the_Foam.jpg" alt="Spoon Out the Foam">
                <h4 class="ingredients">Spoon Out the Foam</h4>
                Take a healthy spoonful of the milk froth and dollop it right onto the espresso shot, creating a nice white cap. If you’ve brewed a double shot (like we have here), two dollops of foam will do.

                <h4 class="ingredients">Serve with Demitasse Spoon</h4>
                Serve the macchiato with a demitasse spoon in case the drinker wants to stir things up, though we recommend drinking it unstirred, for the layering effect’s different taste sensations. Enjoy!

        <h2>How to Make Cappuccino</h2>
        <h3>What is a cappuccino, exactly?</h3>
        <p>
        A <b>cappuccino</b> is an espresso drink with steamed milk, milk foam and espresso. It’s very similar to a latte (cafe latte), but the proportion of steamed milk is different. Here’s the breakdown of a latte vs cappuccino:
        <ol>
            <li class="circle">A cappuccino has equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam (⅓ each).
            </li>
            <li class="circle">A latte is ⅓ espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top. Here’s a chart that breaks it down!</li>
        </ol>
            <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
                <p>
                The differences between the two drinks are pretty subtle, and so is the flavor. But you’re in luck: the cappuccino is the easier of the two to perfect at home. With a latte you’re looking for microfoam, steamed milk with a wet-paint like texture that’s almost impossible to get without an espresso machine. A cappuccino can easily be made with frothed milk using various tools: even a whisk!

            <p>According to legend, 9th-century goat herders discovered how caffeine affected their goats, who looked like they were "dancing" (probably high on caffeine) after eating the Coffea plant's fruit. After that discovery, the cup of coffee as we know it was born when a local monk made a drink with the product and discovered that it kept him awake all night.</p>
